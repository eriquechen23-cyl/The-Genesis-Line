**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (Anime Style) (Cyberpunk) (High Action) The climax of the battle. A split-screen shout triggers a massive impact frame explosion. The enemy is vaporized into black smoke and cyan data cubes. The scene shifts to slow motion as data rains down. Ren lands gracefully and sheathes his sword; Retsu lands heavily and shoulders his axe. They share a silent moment of camaraderie (glance and air fist bump) as the frozen world melts back into green code. The clip ends with a heroic low-angle shot fading into white.
> **[Camera]**: Static Impact, Slow Motion Pan, Hero Low Angle.
> **[Style]**: MAPPA Style, Particle Effects, Beautiful Destruction, Soft Lighting for aftermath.
> **[Audio]**: Explosion decay, sparkling data sounds, triumphant orchestral swell.
