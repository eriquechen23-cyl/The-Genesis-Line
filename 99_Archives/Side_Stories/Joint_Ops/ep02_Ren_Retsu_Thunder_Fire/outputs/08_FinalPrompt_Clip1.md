**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 00s, the camera establishes the Frozen Logic Core with pixelated snow falling on towering servers. As the scene flows to 01.5s, @eriquechen.ren bursts in as a streak of yellow lightning, his feet leaving electric trails on the ice. Then at 03.0s, @eriquechen.ren swings his massive "Logic Breaker" Axe, but at 03.8s, it hits the "Absolute Zero" Ice Shield with no effect, shattering ice particles. Suddenly at 05.2s, @eriquechen.retsu descends from the sky like a meteor, wrapped in red fire. At 06.8s, @eriquechen.retsu's white-hot "Ignition" Katana clashes with the shield, causing a massive steam explosion. The impact at 08.2s knocks @eriquechen.ren off balance, his axe only grazing the enemy. By 11.2s, the enemy's shield morphs into sharp tracking spikes. Finally, at 14.2s, @eriquechen.ren and @eriquechen.retsu stand back-to-back as the spikes launch, and the scene concludes with a high-contrast freeze frame at 15.0s.
