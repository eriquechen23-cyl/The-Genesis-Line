**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (Anime Style) (Cyberpunk) (High Action) The synchronization of Ren and Retsu. Ren creates a blue electric grid on the floor to magnetize ice spikes. Retsu charges his axe to white-hot intensity and uses the grid as a railgun track. The clip features high-speed Z-pattern movement, motion blur, and a "conductor" motif for Ren clearing the path. It ends with a freeze-frame of their combined "X" formation attack.
> **[Camera]**: High-Speed Tracking, Top-Down Grid View, Shaky Cam for speed.
> **[Style]**: MAPPA Style, Speed Lines, Neon Trails, Overexposed Highlights.
> **[Audio]**: Charging sounds, sonic booms, shattering ice.
