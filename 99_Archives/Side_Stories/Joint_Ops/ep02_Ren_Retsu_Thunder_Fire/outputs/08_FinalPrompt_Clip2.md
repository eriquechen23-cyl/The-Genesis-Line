**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 00s, the frozen scene resumes with motion blur as ice spikes accelerate. At 01.5s, a split screen shows @eriquechen.ren's data-filled eye and @eriquechen.retsu's fiery grin speaking in sync. Then at 03.0s, @eriquechen.ren slams his Axe into the ground, activating "System Override: Superconductor", spreading a yellow electric grid that freezes the ice spikes in mid-air at 03.8s. @eriquechen.retsu charges his energy and at 06.8s launches with "Ignition: Railgun Charge", creating a sonic boom. From 07.5s, a top-down view shows a Z-shaped red and yellow light trail cutting through the map as @eriquechen.ren detonates spikes to clear the path. Finally, at 13.5s, the two heroes converge in a massive X-shaped energy formation, and the camera crash-zooms into the blinding light at 14.2s.
