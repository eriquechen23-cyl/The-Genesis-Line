        * **Action**: The shot holds steadily. However, a very subtle, almost imperceptible flicker or glitch effect appears specifically in the background near @eriquechen.lucifer. A single, faint magenta data block might momentarily appear and vanish, hinting at an unresolved issue or impending consequence. This is a very slight visual anomaly, barely noticeable on first glance.
