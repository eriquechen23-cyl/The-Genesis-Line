(MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). At 30s, close-up on @eriquechen.retsu's face. At 31s, his hand presses onto the black Relic. At 32s, red energy veins inject into the core. At 33s, the core begins to glow red from the inside. At 34s, the black surface cracks. At 35s, a clear "Ping" sound ripples visually. At 36s, the Relic shatters. At 37s, it disintegrates into millions of perfect, translucent red data cubes. At 38s, the black chains turn to dust. At 39s, the entire temple purifies from black to white. At 40s, slow motion of red cubes falling like rain. At 41s, Retsu stands amidst the geometric rain, steam rising from his muscles. At 42s, he retracts his hand. At 43s, the red Genesis Lines on his back fade to black. At 44s, back shot looking at the clear horizon. The scene fades out at 45s.
