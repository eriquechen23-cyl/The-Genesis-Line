**[SORA OPTIMIZED PROMPT]**:
(MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). At 15s, time unfreezes and @eriquechen.retsu punches forward. At 16s, a red shockwave hits the chains, but instead of shattering, they splash into sticky black liquid code. At 17s, close-up of the liquid creeping onto his fist. At 18s, Retsu realizes the trap. At 19s, he performs a backflip retreat. At 20s, he lands in a slide, his feet burning red trails on the floor. At 21s, close-up on his face, thinking. At 22s, extreme close-up as he closes his eyes. At 23s, the chaotic flashing of his red lines stabilizes into a high-frequency rhythm. At 24s, high-pitched steam rises from his skin. At 25s, his eyes snap open with focus. At 26s, he vanishes into a red blur. At 27s, he zig-zags left and right, leaving afterimages. At 28s, extreme close-up of a chain missing his face by millimeters. At 29s, he rushes the core. The clip ends at 30s with an extreme close-up of his hand, formed into a claw, stopping exactly 0.1mm from the surface of the black Relic.
