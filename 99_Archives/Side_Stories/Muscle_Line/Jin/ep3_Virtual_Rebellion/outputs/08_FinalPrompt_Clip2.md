**[SORA OPTIMIZED PROMPT]**:
(MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). At 15s, the roller hits, but @eriquechen.jin vanishes into blue particles. At 16s, he is running vertically on the wall, defying gravity. At 17s, the wall ripples under his feet. At 18s, the Prophet, a giant abstract eye, appears in the sky. At 19s, the stairs turn into spikes. At 20s, Jin dodges with acrobatic flips. At 21s, ghost images of "Dead Jin" flash around him. At 22s, extreme close-up of HUD warning "Reality Sync Dropping". At 23s, Jin plunges his hands into the wall's data stream. At 24s, blue virus code injects into the red system. At 25s, blue and red lightning clash violently. At 26s, the red light overwhelms the blue. At 27s, close-up of Jin's hand turning transparent and glitching. At 28s, he is thrown off the wall. At 29s, red data chains erupt and bind his limbs, suspending him in mid-air. The clip ends at 30s with a "NULL" overwrite command hovering over his chest as the screen glitches to black.
