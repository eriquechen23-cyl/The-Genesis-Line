**[SORA OPTIMIZED PROMPT]**:
(MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). At 30s, extreme close-up on @eriquechen.jin's closed eyes in darkness. At 31s, his eyes snap open, glowing with brilliant cyan light. At 32s, a blue shockwave expands, shattering the red chains into glass shards. At 33s, Jin spreads his arms. At 34s, giant holographic wings made of data feathers unfold from his back. At 35s, he clasps his hands, compressing logic into a blue Paradox Orb. At 36s, he fires the orb at the Prophet. At 37s, the orb penetrates the red eye core. At 38s, the core implodes with an electronic scream. At 39s, the entire Babel Tower collapses. At 40s, the geometry dissolves into binary code rain. At 41s, Jin floats amidst the debris. At 42s, his HUD turns green showing "Threat: 0". At 43s, he pushes up his glasses. At 44s, the sky clears to a perfect blue. The scene ends at 45s as Jin fades away into the data stream.
