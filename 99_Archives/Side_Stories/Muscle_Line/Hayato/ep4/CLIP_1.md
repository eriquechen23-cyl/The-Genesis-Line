        * **Action**: An extreme close-up on @eriquechen.hayato's right fist, now a blinding explosion of hard cel-shaded blue-white light, dominating the frame. The light emanates with intense volumetric rays. His fist is held firm, ready for the impending impact. Rough sketchy lines define the remaining visible parts of his gauntlet, barely contained by the immense power. The edges of Leviathan's tail, a blurred mass of magenta glitch blocks, are just entering the very edge of the frame, milliseconds from collision, creating a powerful cliffhanger.
        * **Camera**: Extreme Close-up, held steady and tight on the fist. Obari Perspective to emphasize the concentrated power and the dramatic scale of the impending clash.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Blinding lens flare, radial speed lines from the light, emphasizing the energy.
            - [L2]: Intense energy particles swirling around the fist, creating a dynamic effect.
            - [L3]: The glowing fist, the central point of raw power and defiance.
            - [L4]: The blurred, encroaching edge of Leviathan's tail (magenta glitch blocks), providing the imminent threat.
            - [L5]: (Not applicable).
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime style, rough sketchy lines for the gauntlet, hard cel shading for the intense blue-white light. 'Lost Eden' colors, with the blue-white light overpowering the frame. Extreme volumetric lighting from the fist. Data compression/energy explosion FX.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: ギィィィィン！！ (Giiiiiiin!! - Sustained, high-pitched energy hum), 圧縮エネルギー (Asshuku Energy - Compressed Energy), 衝撃直前 (Shōgeki Chokuzen - Just before impact), 臨界点 (Rinka-ten - Critical Point).
    *   **Transition**: Freeze Frame, then Fade to Black with lingering light

*   **[13.5s~15.0s] Beat**: FREEZE FRAME: The blue light from @eriquechen.hayato's fist dominates the screen, just as Leviathan's tail is about to strike, creating a powerful visual tension. Fade to black with the blue light lingering.
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: A freeze frame from Beat 16. The blinding blue-white light from @eriquechen.hayato's fist is frozen, dominating the screen. The very tip of Leviathan's magenta glitch-block tail is frozen millimeters from impact, creating a powerful visual tension. The scene is held in a moment of extreme, suspended confrontation before slowly fading to black.
        * **Camera**: Freeze Frame, held for dramatic effect, then a slow fade.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Frozen lens flare, frozen speed lines, capturing the instant of power.
            - [L2]: Frozen energy particles, suspended in time.
            - [L3]: The glowing fist and the tip of Leviathan's tail, locked in an instant before collision.
            - [L4]: (Not applicable).
            - [L5]: (Not applicable).
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime style, rough sketchy lines, hard cel shading. 'Lost Eden' colors, with the blue-white light and magenta tail frozen in stark contrast. Intense volumetric lighting, which then slowly diminishes as the screen fades.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: (Sustained, high-pitched hum of energy, slowly fading out) キィィィィィィン…… (Kiiiiiiin...), 緊張の静寂 (Kinchou no Seijaku - Tense Silence). BGM fades with the light, leaving a single, high-frequency synth tone that also fades.
    *   **Transition**: Slow Fade to Black. The blue light from the fist is the last element to fade, lingering for a moment before the screen goes completely dark, leaving the audience in suspense.
