    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: A breathtaking DRAMATIC WIDE SHOT captures the cyber cyan energy from @eriquechen.hayato's fist and the intense red energy from Leviathan's Hyper Beam at the absolute point of collision, just before actual contact. The visual space itself appears to tear and warp, with glitch artifacts and tearing data lines emanating from the point of imminent impact. The two opposing colors dominate the frame, creating a chaotic, overwhelming maelstrom of light and raw energy.
        * **Camera**: DRAMATIC WIDE SHOT, slightly pulling back to capture the monumental scale of the impending clash, emphasizing the distortion of the environment.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Extreme lens flares, chromatic aberration, and intense digital distortion, blurring the edges of the frame.
            - [L2]: Swirling, volatile energy particles of both cyber cyan and red, violently mixing.
            - [L3]: The two opposing forces (Cyber Cyan fist and Red beam) at the very cusp of impact, tearing the space.
            - [L4]: The warped and tearing data-space around the clash, showing signs of imminent collapse.
            - [L5]: The deep ink black void, threatening to be consumed by the chaotic energy.
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime Style, highly dynamic rough sketchy lines for the energy, hard cel shading. Intense Cyber Cyan and Red. Extreme volumetric lighting, creating a blinding, chaotic, and overwhelming effect. Data destruction FX at its absolute peak.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: グァァァァァァァァァァァン！！！ (GUAAAAAAAAAAN!!!) - A deafening, building roar of clashing energy, digitally distorted and stretched, but not yet a full explosion, creating immense tension.
    *   **Transition**: FREEZE FRAME

*   **[14.0s~15.0s] Beat**: FREEZE FRAME: The conflicting red and blue energy, momentarily static, creating an overwhelming sense of impending collision. Fade to white/blue flash.
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: The visual from Beat 18 FREEZES, capturing the raw, static tension of the impending collision. The glitch artifacts and tearing data lines are suspended, creating a moment of overwhelming, silent dread. The cyber cyan and red energies are locked in a silent, overwhelming struggle. This is followed by a rapid, blinding fade to pure white, then a final, lingering cyber cyan flash, leaving the outcome ambiguous.
        * **Camera**: FREEZE FRAME, then rapid fade out.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Frozen lens flares, static digital noise and distortion.
            - [L2]: Suspended energy particles, momentarily static.
            - [L3]: The frozen clash of Cyber Cyan and Red energy, locked in an eternal struggle.
            - [L4]: The static, warped data-space around the impact point.
            - [L5]: Deep ink black, then entirely consumed by a blinding white flash, followed by a lingering cyber cyan afterglow.
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime Style, frozen rough sketchy lines, static hard cel shading. Intense Cyber Cyan and Red. Lingering volumetric lighting. The fade transitions from sharp detail to pure, ethereal light.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: (The building sound from the previous beat abruptly cuts, leaving a ringing, distorted silence, followed by a sharp, high-frequency digital *CRACK* and a rapid whoosh that fades out with the flash).
    *   **Transition**: FADE TO WHITE/BLUE FLASH
