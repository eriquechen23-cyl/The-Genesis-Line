「Night, Ruins Ground Level; Flash Freeze, Shattering Ice, Diamond Dust.
主角：**Frozen Beasts**, **Kamiya Hayato**.
動作 (Act & Beat)：

**Act 1 (0.0s - 5.0s): Absolute Zero (極致冰封)**
* **Intent**: 瞬間的物理狀態改變，衝擊感最大化。
* **Beat 1.1 (0.0s-1.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Impact] The bullet connects. **Frame 1: Contact**. **Frame 2: Massive Blue Sphere expansion**.
* **Beat 1.2 (1.0s-3.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Reaction] The Lead Beast is frozen mid-lunge. Ice crystals spike out from its back instantly.
* **Beat 1.3 (3.0s-5.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Wide Pan] The freeze spreads like a wave. All surrounding beasts turn into blue statues in distinct, dynamic poses.

**Act 2 (5.0s - 10.0s): The Shatter (連鎖崩解)**
* **Intent**: 聲音視覺化與畫面破碎的快感。
* **Beat 2.1 (5.0s-6.5s)**:
    * **Action**: [Tension] **Silence**. Camera zooms in on a tiny crack on the ice face. Text: "Gichi... (ギチ…)" floats nearby.
* **Beat 2.2 (6.5s-8.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Detonation] **CHAIN REACTION**. The first beast shatters. Then the second. Then the third.
* **Beat 2.3 (8.0s-10.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Particle Chaos] The screen is filled with **Diamond Dust** (millions of sparkling particles). No gore, just beautiful, sharp ice debris flying towards the camera (3D depth).

**Act 3 (10.0s - 15.0s): The Aftermath (殘心)**
* **Intent**: 歸於平靜，強調角色的「格」。
* **Beat 3.1 (10.0s-12.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Cut Back] High Ground. Hayato lowers the gun. Smoke rises vertically (no wind).
* **Beat 3.2 (12.0s-13.5s)**:
    * **Action**: [Lip Sync] Close up. He whispers: "Told you... one shot."
* **Beat 3.3 (13.5s-15.0s)**:
    * **Action**: [Walk Away] He turns around, coat flaring. The background is a "Snowfall" of glittering ice dust from the explosion below.

漫畫特效：floating SFX text "ギチ…" and "パリーン" (Shatter sound) in 3D space.
