**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading). At 00s, in a dark neon server highway, the environment is freezing into **Blue Wireframes**. @eriquechen.hayato stands amidst floating **White Hexagonal Forcefields**. His breath forms pixelated mist. At 05s, the camera tracks rapidly as Hayato sprints, leaving **Blue Data Trails**. He dodges expanding white barriers with fluid, glitch-like movements. At 10s, a barrier touches his left arm, instantly rendering it into a transparent blue wireframe mesh. The texture is digital and hollow.
> **[Camera]**: High-speed tracking, sudden freeze-frame effects.
> **[Style]**: Cold color palette (Cyan, Deep Blue, White), high contrast, sharp line art.
> **[Audio]**: Digital crystallization sounds, wind howling.
