**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 30s, `@eriquechen.renka` smiles confidently before activating **Phantom Blade Dance** at 31s, splitting into multiple visual echoes. At 33s, a flurry of rapid cuts shows her slashing the **Road Rage Overlord** tank from every angle simultaneously, creating a stroboscopic effect of pink light. By 35s, she lands behind the frozen tank. At 36s, glowing pink cracks appear on the tank's armor, forming a sakura flower pattern. At 37s, the camera focuses on her hand slowly sheathing the katana. The moment the guard clicks at 38s, the tank behind her explodes into a massive storm of pink sakura petals at 39s. Renka walks away from the explosion without looking back at 41s, adjusting her hair as the petals rain down around her. The scene concludes at 43s with a wide shot of her continuing down the infinite neon highway under a giant cyber-moon.
> **[Camera]**: Disorienting rapid cuts for the combo, steady cam for the resolution, and a classic "Cool guys don't look at explosions" framing.
> **[Style]**: Visual overload during the combo, transitioning to a serene, poetic "Sakura Storm" aesthetic.
> **[Audio]**: Silence during the strikes, a sharp click, followed by a thunderous yet beautiful explosion sound.

**[TECHNICAL SPECS] (Render Config):**
