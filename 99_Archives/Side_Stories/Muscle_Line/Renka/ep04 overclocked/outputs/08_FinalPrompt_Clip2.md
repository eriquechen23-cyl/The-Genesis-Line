**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 15s, a spiked chain flies directly at the camera, aiming for `@eriquechen.renka`. At 17s, just as the chain hits, Renka activates **Sonic Bloom**, her body smearing into a pink blur, causing the chain to pass through her afterimage. At 19s, a wide shot captures a perfect pink energy arc slicing across the highway, cutting the lead biker and his machine in half. By 20s, the cut surfaces dissolve into beautiful pink sakura petals instead of gore. From 21s to 24s, Renka dances through the remaining enemies, her movements creating zig-zag light trails, leaving a wake of red explosions behind her. At 26s, the massive **Road Rage Overlord** tank blocks the path, its spiked grinder wheels spinning menacingly. The clip ends at 29s with a close-up of Renka, her eyes glowing as she activates "Overclock Mode", a pink aura flaring around her ready for the final clash.
> **[Camera]**: Dynamic action cam, slow-motion impacts, wide shots for scale, and intense close-ups.
> **[Style]**: High-contrast action, "Sakura" particle effects replacing blood, neon pink vs industrial grey.
> **[Audio]**: Heavy Dubstep drop, rhythmic slashing sounds, and the grinding of heavy metal.
