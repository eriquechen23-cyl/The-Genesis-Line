**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 00s, the camera tracks alongside `@eriquechen.renka` as she sprints down a neon-lit data highway, her body streamlined like a bullet. At 01s, pink light trails stream from her form, emphasizing her supersonic speed. By 02s, the camera cuts to an extreme close-up of her **Anti-Gravity Greaves** touching the circuit-board road, generating pixelated sparks. At 04s, the perspective shifts to her POV, where the world slows down; billboards and data packets float in frozen time. At 06s, a side profile shows Renka adjusting her headset, her eyes narrowing in focus at 07s. At 08s, the focus snaps to her hand resting on her katana hilt, the sakura patterns glowing pink in rhythm. Suddenly at 10s, a holographic rear-view window pops up, revealing the **Speed Demon Virus** gang approaching. At 12s, the gang's digital motorcycles roar into view, their wheels burning with red error code flames. At 13s, spiked chains drag on the ground, throwing sparks. Finally, at 14s, the gang engages their nitro boosts, turning into red meteors that chase after the distant pink figure of Renka.
> **[Camera]**: High-speed tracking shots, sudden POV shifts, and dynamic close-ups of gear.
> **[Style]**: Cyberpunk neon aesthetic, high contrast between Pink (Renka) and Red (Enemies), digital glitch effects.
> **[Audio]**: Fast-paced Drum & Bass, wind shear, and aggressive engine roars.

**[TECHNICAL SPECS] (Render Config):**
