**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 00s, a low angle shot reveals the massive, imposing black metal walls of Sector 777, with `@eriquechen.yenli` standing as a tiny figure at the base. At 01s, the camera zooms in rapidly. At 02s, steam vents violently. At 03s, Yenli tilts his head up. By 04s, his POV shows red "ACCESS DENIED" holographic windows popping up, flashing rapidly at 04.5s. At 05s, he narrows his eyes. At 06s, a distant turret rotates, its lens flaring red at 06.5s before firing at 07s. At 08s, in slow motion, a plasma shot travels towards him. At 08.5s, he barely tilts his head, and the shot explodes behind him at 09s. At 10s, dust settles on his shoulder. At 11s, he calmly brushes it off. At 12s, his fist clenches, veins glowing green at 12.5s. At 13s, his **Genesis Line** tattoo ignites with neon light. At 13.5s, he winds up, and at 14s, his fist connects with the wall, creating a massive shockwave at 14.5s that distorts the air.
> **[Camera]**: Low angles to emphasize scale, snap zooms on the sniper, and slow-motion for the dodge.
> **[Style]**: Heavy industrial aesthetic, rust and metal textures, high contrast between black metal and green energy.
> **[Audio]**: Heavy industrial metal track, deep bass machine hums, and a deafening impact sound at the end.
