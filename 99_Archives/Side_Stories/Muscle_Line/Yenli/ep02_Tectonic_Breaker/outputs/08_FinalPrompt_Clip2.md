**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k). Continuing from 15s, cracks spread rapidly across the wall before it shatters outwards at 15.5s. At 17s, `@eriquechen.yenli` emerges from the thick dust cloud, his green eyes glowing at 18s. By 19s, a swarm of security drones descends, locking on at 19.5s and firing a laser volley at 20s. The lasers hit his skin at 20.5s, creating sparks at 21s, but he remains unharmed. At 21.5s, Yenli looks annoyed, muttering "Too noisy." At 23s, he grabs a car-sized chunk of debris, his fingers crushing the metal at 23.5s. At 24s, his muscles expand. At 25s, he lifts the debris, spins, and releases it at 26s. The rock flies like a meteor at 27s, creating a sonic boom. At 28s, it smashes into the central sniper tower, obliterating the mid-section. The clip ends at 29s with the massive tower slowly tipping over, while Yenli watches calmly.
> **[Camera]**: Handheld shaky cam during the drone attack, smooth tracking shot for the throw, wide shot for the tower collapse.
> **[Style]**: Chaotic battle scene, high particle count (dust, sparks, debris), dynamic lighting from lasers and explosions.
> **[Audio]**: Fast-paced drum beat, high-pitched laser sounds contrasting with the heavy bass of the rock throw.

**[TECHNICAL SPECS] (Render Config):**
*   **Model**: Runway Gen-3 Alpha
*   **Aspect Ratio**: --ar 16:9
