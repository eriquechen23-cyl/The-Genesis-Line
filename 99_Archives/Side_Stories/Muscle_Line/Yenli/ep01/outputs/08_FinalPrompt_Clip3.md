At 30.5s, speed lines and air distortion emphasize the force. At 31s, `@eriquechen.yenli` activates Rooting. By 31.5s, green roots penetrate the rock. At 32s, the hammer strikes `@eriquechen.yenli`. At 33s, a ring-shaped dust cloud explodes. At 34s, the dust clears to reveal him holding the hammer. At 35s, his muscles bulge and veins glow. At 36s, he jumps and forms the Gauntlet. By 37s, rocks magnetically attach to his arm. At 38s, the gauntlet overflows with energy. At 39s, green light leaks from the cracks. At 40s, the punch connects with the Colossus. At 40.5s, the screen flashes with inverted colors and "DELETE" text. At 41s, the Colossus shatters. By 42s, ice crystals fly at the camera. At 43s, `@eriquechen.yenli` lands. At 44s, the gauntlet crumbles to dust. Finally, at 45s, he walks away, and at 45.5s, the scene fades to black.

**[NEGATIVE PROMPT] (Safety Protocol):**
> (photorealistic), (3d render), (unreal engine), (hyperrealistic), (live action), (cinematic lighting), (8k photography), (bokeh), (depth of field), (ray tracing), (bad anatomy), (extra limbs), (missing fingers), (fused fingers), (bad hands), (mutated), (deformed), (blurry), (low quality), (jpeg artifacts), (text), (watermark), (signature), (username), (subtitles), (UI elements), (HUD), (loading bar), (blood), (gore), (red liquid), (viscera), (exposed organs).

**[CRITIC'S VERDICT]**
> **Score**: 95/100
> **Comment**: The "Obari Perspective" on the hammer swing is a great stylistic choice. The "DELETE" text flash adds a nice meta-layer to the combat. Perfect climax.
