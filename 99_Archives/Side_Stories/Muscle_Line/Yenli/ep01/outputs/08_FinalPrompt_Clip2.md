**[NEGATIVE PROMPT] (Safety Protocol):**
> (photorealistic), (3d render), (unreal engine), (hyperrealistic), (live action), (cinematic lighting), (8k photography), (bokeh), (depth of field), (ray tracing), (bad anatomy), (extra limbs), (missing fingers), (fused fingers), (bad hands), (mutated), (deformed), (blurry), (low quality), (jpeg artifacts), (text), (watermark), (signature), (username), (subtitles), (UI elements), (HUD), (loading bar), (blood), (gore), (red liquid), (viscera), (exposed organs).

**[CRITIC'S VERDICT]**
> **Score**: 92/100
> **Comment**: The impact frames on the bite and the ground punch are visceral. The "Despawn" effect on the enemies aligns perfectly with the digital setting.
