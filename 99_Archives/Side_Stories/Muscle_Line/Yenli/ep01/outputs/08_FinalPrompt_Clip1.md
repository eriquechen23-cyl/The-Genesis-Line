**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> {core/prompt_engineer.md}
> (MAPPA Anime Style, Cel Shading, 4k, High Resolution). Starting at 00s, the camera pans across the Shattered Canyon. At 01s, rocks flicker with purple wireframe glitches due to rendering errors. By 02s, the shot cuts to `@eriquechen.yenli` sitting in a lotus position, absolutely still. At 02.5s, dust settles on his shoulder, emphasizing his immobility. At 03s, the camera zooms into an extreme close-up of his chest, focusing on the Genesis Line. By 03.5s, the green light pulses in sync with a deep server hum. At 04s, the perspective shifts to a sensory mode, visualizing the wind as binary code. At 05s, code streams flow past the camera. Suddenly at 06s, pebbles on the ground vibrate. By 06.5s, the vibration intensity increases, blurring the edges. At 07s, the camera pulls back to reveal Glitch Hounds emerging from the shadows. At 08s, hundreds of red eyes light up sequentially. At 09s, `@eriquechen.yenli`'s eyes snap open. By 09.5s, green data streams flow across his iris. At 10s, he presses his hand to the rock surface. At 11s, a green grid pattern spreads from his palm. At 12s, the hounds begin their charge. By 13s, they turn into red motion blur streaks. Finally, at 14s, the scene slows down as his pupil contracts, and at 14.5s, time dilation fully takes effect.

**[TECHNICAL SPECS] (Render Config):**
*   **Model**: Runway Gen-3 Alpha
*   **Aspect Ratio**: --ar 16:9
*   **Frame Rate**: 24fps

**[NEGATIVE PROMPT] (Safety Protocol):**
> (photorealistic), (3d render), (unreal engine), (hyperrealistic), (live action), (cinematic lighting), (8k photography), (bokeh), (depth of field), (ray tracing), (bad anatomy), (extra limbs), (missing fingers), (fused fingers), (bad hands), (mutated), (deformed), (blurry), (low quality), (jpeg artifacts), (text), (watermark), (signature), (username), (subtitles), (UI elements), (HUD), (loading bar), (blood), (gore), (red liquid), (viscera), (exposed organs).

**[CRITIC'S VERDICT]**
> **Score**: 90/100
> **Comment**: Excellent buildup of tension. The transition from static meditation to the chaotic swarm is well-paced. The use of "binary code wind" adds a nice sensory layer.
