        * **Action**: MEDIUM SHOT of `@eriquechen.hayato`'s face. `@eriquechen.hayato`'s expression is utterly devoid of emotion, a mask of impassive analysis. Slowly, deliberately, `@eriquechen.hayato` turns `@eriquechen.hayato`'s head towards `@eriquechen.ren`. Volumetric lighting from an unseen source catches the sharp angles of `@eriquechen.hayato`'s jawline and the bridge of `@eriquechen.hayato`'s nose, creating stark contrasts. `@eriquechen.hayato`'s eyes, though unblinking, convey a deep, calculating intensity.

    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: WIDE SHOT of the desolate, cratered landscape. The camera performs a slow Dolly Zoom out, revealing the immense scale of destruction—a vast, perfectly circular crater where a lake once was, its edges still shimmering with dissipating Magenta glitch voxels. Above, the sky is serene but digital, with faint Cyber Cyan wireframe patterns and binary code subtly visible against the Deep Ink Black. The contrast between the calm, digital environment and the raw destruction is stark and unsettling. Ren and Hayato are tiny figures at the edge of the crater, emphasizing their insignificance against the power displayed.
