*   **[12.6s~13.3s] Beat**: PANNING SHOT: From the now dry, cratered basin where the lake was, across to the perfect donut-shaped remains of the mountain. (Reveal of aftermath)
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: A deliberate PANNING SHOT that starts on the now dry, cratered basin where the Data Lake once was. Residual cyber cyan patterns shimmer faintly on its desolate surface. The camera slowly pans across the barren, deep ink black landscape, revealing the vast, circular path of destruction, eventually settling on the 'perfect donut-shaped remains' of the mountain. Its edges are still sharp and defined by hard cel shading, with a subtle, lingering magenta/purple glow. Volumetric lighting from the distant horizon casts long, stark shadows.
        * **Camera**: Panning Shot, slightly high angle, moving deliberately across the transformed landscape.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Subtle atmospheric haze and distant, shimmering heat distortion.

    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: An expansive OVERHEAD SHOT revealing the entire transformed landscape. The colossal crater, the dry, scarred basin, and the perfect donut-shaped mountain remains are all visible in stark, silent contrast to the beginning of the clip. The 'Lost Eden' palette is used to emphasize the desolation: dominant deep ink black, with sharp cyber cyan and magenta lines defining the scars of destruction. A single, powerful shaft of volumetric light pierces the deep ink black sky, dramatically highlighting the crater's immense scale.
        * **Camera**: OVERHEAD SHOT (satellite-like), with a very slow, imperceptible zoom out to emphasize the vastness.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Subtle atmospheric distortion and distant, barely visible glitch artifacts.
            - [L2]: The entire transformed landscape, a tapestry of destruction.
            - [L3]: The central features: crater, basin, mountain remains.
            - [L4]: The vast, barren expanse of the deep ink black world.
            - [L5]: The deep ink black void above, with a dramatic volumetric light shaft.
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime Style, rough sketchy lines, hard cel shading. Color: Cyber Cyan / Magenta / Deep Ink Black. Lighting: Moody Low-key, dramatic Volumetric Lighting. FX: Stark, defined scars of data destruction.

*   **[14.0s~15.0s] Beat**: SILENCE. A beat of complete, eerie quiet, emphasizing the destruction. (Emphasis on aftermath)
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: The overhead shot of the transformed landscape holds, or slowly zooms out further, emphasizing the scale of the destruction and the chilling emptiness. The 'Lost Eden' palette remains, stark and unyielding. The image is still, allowing the viewer to absorb the aftermath.
        * **Camera**: Hold shot, or a very subtle, almost imperceptible slow zoom out.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Minimal atmospheric distortion.
