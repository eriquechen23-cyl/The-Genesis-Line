    *   **Audio**: SFX: ドォン！ (Dooon!) - powerful release sound, スピン！ (Supin!) - subtle whirring of the fragment.
    *   **Transition**: Hard Cut

*   **[13.5s~14.2s] Beat**: SFX (Japanese): ヒュン！ (HYUN!) - Sharp whoosh of the fragment.
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: SFX (Japanese): ヒュン！ (HYUN!) - Sharp whoosh of the fragment.
        * **Camera**: Dolly Zoom from the fragment's release point, tracking it for a very brief moment, then a Hard Cut to the next tracking shot.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Intense, streaking speed lines (cyber cyan) blurring the foreground.
            - [L2]: Blurry elements of the environment rushing past, highly distorted.
            - [L3]: The Data Fragment, now a fast-moving blur, with a faint magenta/cyan wireframe trail indicating its trajectory and glitching energy.
            - [L4]: Blurry Data Lake surface, streaking horizontally.
            - [L5]: N/A.
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime Style. Rough sketchy lines on FX, hard cel shading. Colors: Grey fragment, cyber cyan/magenta trail, deep ink black outlines on blurry environment. Lighting is dramatic, emphasizing speed and motion blur.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: ヒュン！ (HYUN!) - very sharp, fast whoosh.
    *   **Transition**: Hard Cut

*   **[14.2s~15.0s] Beat**: TRACKING SHOT: The grey Data Fragment skims low over the perfectly flat Data Lake surface, a faint trail behind it. (Reaction)
    *   **Visuals**:
        * **Action**: The grey Data Fragment skims low over the perfectly flat Data Lake surface, a faint trail behind it. (Reaction)
        * **Camera**: TRACKING SHOT, low angle, following the Data Fragment as it skims across the lake. Slight Obari Perspective to emphasize the flat surface and the fragment's speed.
        * **Layout**:
            - [L1]: Subtle lens distortion/chromatic aberration (magenta/cyan) at the edges of the frame.
            - [L2]: Subtle ripples/data splashes (cyber cyan) where the fragment just skimmed the surface, appearing as fleeting wireframes.
            - [L3]: The grey Data Fragment, perfectly skimming the surface, leaving a faint, glitching wireframe trail (magenta/cyber cyan) that dissipates quickly.
            - [L4]: The perfectly flat, reflective Data Lake surface, stretching to the distant data mountain (deep ink black outline).
            - [L5]: Digital sky, with volumetric magenta/cyber cyan energy swirling and reflecting on the lake surface.
        * **Art & FX**: MAPPA Anime Style. Rough sketchy lines for the trail and subtle data ripples, hard cel shading. Colors: Grey fragment, vibrant cyber cyan lake, magenta/cyan trail and sky energy. Lighting is dramatic, with volumetric light rays interacting with the lake surface and fragment's trail.
    *   **Audio**: SFX: シュルルルル... (Shururururu...) - continuous skimming sound, スゥーッ (Suuu-) - smooth gliding sound. BGM: High-tension electronic sustain, with a subtle underlying rumble.
    *   **Transition**: Glitch Wipe
