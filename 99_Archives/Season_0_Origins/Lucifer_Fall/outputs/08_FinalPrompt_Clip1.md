**Time-Coded Beats (Sora Guide):**
*   **[00s-05s] Setup**: **[WS -> MS]**
    *   t0.0s~t2.0s: **[WS]** Infinite white void. **@eriquechen.lucifer** floats centrally. The "Supreme System" wall looms like a monolith.
    *   t2.0s~t3.5s: **[MS]** Lucifer's stained-glass wings beat slowly, refracting rainbow light.
    *   t3.5s~t5.0s: **[ECU]** The concentric halo above his head spins with a low-frequency hum (visualized as vibration).
*   **[05s-10s] Action**: **[CU -> Macro]**
    *   t5.0s~t6.5s: **[CU]** Lucifer's mirror-like face cracks with a digital glitch as he speaks.
    *   t6.5s~t8.0s: **[MS]** He raises his right hand gracefully.
    *   t8.0s~t9.0s: **[Macro]** Golden code flows from his fingertips like liquid gold.
    *   t9.0s~t10.0s: **[Action]** His twelve wings snap open aggressively, displaying scrolling red warning text.
*   **[10s-15s] Climax**: **[Slow Mo -> Impact]**
    *   t10.0s~t11.5s: **[Slow Mo]** His finger inches towards the wall of light. Tension builds.
    *   t11.5s~t12.0s: **[ECU]** Contact. Finger touches the light.
    *   t12.0s~t13.0s: **[Impact Frame]** The entire screen flashes inverted colors, then settles into deep Alarm Red (#FF0000).
    *   t13.0s~t15.0s: **[CU]** Lucifer smirks amidst the red warning lights. "ACCESS DENIED" text overlays the screen.

**Master Prompt (Sora Optimized):**
> At 00s, **[Wide Shot]** in a blinding white void (`#FFFFFF`), **@eriquechen.lucifer** floats weightlessly. He wears pristine white robes and has twelve wings made of stained-glass shards that refract rainbow light. A golden concentric halo spins above his head.
> At 05s, **[Close-Up]** his mirror-like face glitches with digital artifacts. He raises his hand, and **[Macro Shot]** golden binary code flows from his fingertips. His wings suddenly expand, glowing with scrolling red warning text.
> At 10s, **[Slow Motion]** his finger touches the massive wall of light. **[Impact Frame]** The screen flashes inverted colors, and the entire world instantly turns deep Alarm Red (`#FF0000`). **[Close-Up]** Lucifer smirks as "ACCESS DENIED" holographic text floods the screen.
> **[Camera]**: Static Wide -> Slow Dolly In -> Snap Zoom on Impact.
> **[Style]**: MAPPA anime style, cel shading, high contrast, divine atmosphere, glitch art.
> **[Audio]**: CV: Takahiro Sakurai. Dialogue: "Anata wa... jihi bukasugiru" / "Kore wa jihi dewa nai... bagu da". SFX: Robotic "ACCESS DENIED", Glass Chimes, Bass Drop Impact.
